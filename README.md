# Weather Data 🌦️ EDA & Prediction 🔮

This project analyzes historical weather data and builds a **machine learning model to predict future weather conditions**.
It includes both exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling — all implemented inside [`Here`](weather-data-eda-prediction.ipynb).

## 📚 Project Overview

Weather forecasting is essential in agriculture, disaster management, transportation, and daily decision-making.
Using data science, we can extract patterns from historical weather data and use them to predict future conditions.

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and then builds regression models to predict weather metrics such as temperature and humidity.

## 🚀 How the Project Works

The full workflow is available in [`Here`](weather-data-eda-prediction.ipynb):

1. **Import Libraries**

   * Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.

2. **Load Dataset**

   * Weather data is imported and basic statistics are explored.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Visualizations of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and more.
   * Insights into seasonal and temporal trends.

4. **Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values and preparing features for modeling.

5. **Modeling**

   * Linear Regression and other ML models to predict weather metrics.

6. **Evaluation**

   * Model performance is measured using RMSE and R² scores.

7. **Visualization**

   * Actual vs. predicted plots help evaluate the model visually.

## 📈 Results

* The model showed **reasonable prediction accuracy** for selected weather variables.
* EDA revealed important seasonal trends and correlations among variables.

(*You can optionally include plots or numeric performance here.*)

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

Install all required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(*Optional: Create a `requirements.txt` file for easy setup.*)

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Use advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Add time series forecasting using ARIMA or LSTM.
* Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
